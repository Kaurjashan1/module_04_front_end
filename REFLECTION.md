# Can I explain what my code does?

The code creates an accessible web survey form with client-side validation and user-friendly interactions
It captures user information through various input types (text, email, radio buttons, dropdown) with built-in error checking
The form ensures data integrity through JavaScript validation and provides clear feedback to users during input

## What was my coding process?

Began by designing the HTML structure with semantic markup and accessibility in mind
Implemented progressive enhancement by adding CSS for styling and JavaScript for form validation
Focused on creating an intuitive user interface with clear labeling and error handling mechanisms

## What challenges did I have?

Implementing comprehensive form validation without cluttering the user interface
Ensuring cross-browser compatibility and responsive design
Balancing accessibility requirements with a clean, minimalist design approach

## What would I do differently now?

Enhance error messaging with more detailed and user-friendly validation feedback
Implement more advanced client-side validation techniques
